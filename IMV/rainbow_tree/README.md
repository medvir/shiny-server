# Rainbow Tree

Rainbow Tree Tool from the HIV sequence database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/RAINBOWTREE/rainbowtree.html) as an interactive Web application (R shiny app).  
The input is an aligned fasta file (no need to create a Newick tree) and it has the same functionality as the Rainbow Tree Tool.  
The shiny app works only within the UZH network.
